This is my web development learning repository. A collection of exercises, experiments and personal projects.
IÂ´m currently building my personal portfolio website, mobile first, from top to bottom.
I started seriously learning javascript during the pandemic, thanks to online learning platforms like freeCodeCamp and frontendmentor.
