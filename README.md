This is my web dev portfolio repository. A collection of exercises, experiments and personal projects.
IÂ´m currently learning React, Node, Mongo, APIs, user Auth and so on.
I started seriously learning javascript during the pandemic, thanks to great online teachers like Wes Bos, and learning platforms like freeCodeCamp and frontendmentor.
